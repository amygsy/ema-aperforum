The Extraordinary Meeting will provide a platform for APER members to share the regulatory challenges and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in their countries, learn from each other’s best practices and responses, and exchange views on the future of energy post COVID-19.  This would also be an opportunity for APER members to touch base this year, while we work towards a physical meeting in 2021.

**Agenda**

*a) Regulatory Challenges and Economic Impacts of COVID-19*
This plenary discussion session presents a platform for members to exchange their organization’s best measures and practices in response to regulatory challenges and wider economic implications of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 
*b)The Post Covid-19 Future of Energy*
This plenary discussion session allows members to share their outlook of new regulatory opportunities after COVID-19, such as the transition of energy systems
towards greater sustainability, supply chain resilience and increased international cooperation for a clean energy future.
