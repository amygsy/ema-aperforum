| 10.00am - 12.30pm | **Pre-APER Forum Workshop**<br><br>Our energy landscape is evolving quickly. Energy regulators are seeking to ensure the stability and resilience of the power systems, and coping with the higher penetration of intermittent generation sources. At the same time, electricity markets are gradually transitioning from single-buyer model market structures to liberalised electricity markets with the aim of delivering lower costs for consumers.<br><br>This session will serve as a scene-setter for the discussions at the APER Plenary Meeting. This workshop will provide an introductory overview on the current outlook of the global energy landscape, and discuss key trends and their implications for energy regulators.<br><br>_*Possible discussion themes*_<br>1. Electricity Market Design and Models<br>2. Systems Integration of Renewable Energy<br>3. Cybersecurity for the Energy Sector |
